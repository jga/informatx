This website will apply techniques from the field of [urban informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_informatics) to the study of policy-making and planning in the Austin, Texas metro region. Topics and data will center on timely policy issues from the metropolitan area, with a primary focus on the city of Austin itself.

This website is a project of Julio Gonzalez Altamirano.
